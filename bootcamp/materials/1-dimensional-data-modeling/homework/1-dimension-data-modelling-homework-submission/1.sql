-- 1. **DDL for `actors` table:** Create a DDL for an `actors` table with the following fields:
--     - `films`: An array of `struct` with the following fields:
-- 		- film: The name of the film.
-- 		- votes: The number of votes the film received.
-- 		- rating: The rating of the film.
-- 		- filmid: A unique identifier for each film.

-- 		- `star`: Average rating > 8.
-- 		- `good`: Average rating > 7 and ≤ 8.
-- 		- `average`: Average rating > 6 and ≤ 7.
-- 		- `bad`: Average rating ≤ 6.
--     - `is_active`: A BOOLEAN field that indicates whether an actor is currently active in the film industry (i.e., making films this year).


CREATE TYPE films AS (
	film TEXT,
	votes INTEGER,
	rating REAL,
	filmid TEXT
);

CREATE TYPE quality_class AS ENUM ('bad', 'average', 'good', 'star');
